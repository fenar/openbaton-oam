Welcome to OpenBaton Demo!

Prep:
(1) Goto /sademos/NFV/OpenBaton then -> $ git clone https://github.com/openbaton/juju-charm openbaton-charm
    NOTE: If we need to get developer $ branch-> $ git clone -b develop https://github.com/openbaton/juju-charm.git openbaton-charm
(2) Goto /srv/data then -> $ wget https://owncloud.fokus.fraunhofer.de/index.php/s/YpkFNUdlXm8Lry0/download
    rename file to openims.img
(3) On Mikrotik Router:
    (a) Go to IP -> Firewall
    (b) Disable Rule#6 that causes packet drops.

Order of Execution:
(Step-0) Bootstrap Juju Controller: ./00-juju-controller-bootstrap.sh

(Step-1) Deploy Openstack with Open Baton Inside: ./01-deploy-openstack.sh

(Step-2) Make sure all OpenStack components are active checking "juju status", otherwise some provisioning calls won't work. 
	 Provision Openstack with Sample Networks & Images: ./02-provision-openstack

(Step-3) Provision Juju-VNFM with: ./04-provision-juju-vnfm.sh. 
         Please be aware that this step may require quite a lot of time, as a juju bootstraps inside an OpenStack VM

(Step-4) Go to:
	 OpenBaton Web Portal http://<openbaton-ip>:8080 admin/openbaton
         Zabbix Web Portal: http://<openbaton-ip>/zabbix/zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view

(Step-5) Check VIM Registration Status: On OpenBaton Web GUI go to Manage-PoPs -> PoP-Instances -> Make sure you have your OB-Openstack Registered,
	 in case the obcontroller vim does not show up, it is better to do: 
		juju remove-relation keystone openbaton 
		juju add-relation keystone openbaton

(Step-6) Access the Open Baton Dashboard, go to Manage-PoPs -> PoP-Instances -> gen_datacenter and click the refresh status button.
	 If the obcontroller datacenter is not there, you may need to trigger again the juju add-relation keystone openbaton

	 # Monitoring VNFs deployed by Open Baton
	 Each time you deploy network services, VMs exeucting VNFs will be automatically monitored by Zabbix. 
	 Zabbix dashboard is available at  http://<openbaton-ip>/zabbix Admin/zabbix

# deploy IMS using Generic VNFM
(Step-7) Go to Catalogue --> Marketplace --> NSDs. Click on Downalod of NSD named: "OpenIMSCoreBind9FHoSS"

(Step-8) Go to Catalogue --> NS Descriptors --> Click on action button of NSD with name "OpenIMSCore Bind9 FHoSS" --> Click Launch
	 In the menu which pops up you don't need to select anything, just click Launch

(Step-9) Go to Orchestrate NS --> NS records:
	 The deployed Network Service should be in the list. If it goes in ERROR, you could see some more details in its sub menu

(Step-10) Validate IMS: ongoing....
		HSS-FE : http://fhoss-ip:8080/hss.web.console/
		username: hssAdmin
		password: hss
               
		Test User: alice@open-ims
		Secret: alice
# NOTES:
(1) In order to pass sctp traffic following kernel modules needs to be loaded:
sudo modprobe nf_conntrack_proto_sctp
sudo modprobe nf_nat_proto_sctp 

(2) Create User with All Access in mme & hss mysql db:
CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'admin';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'admin'@'localhost'; 
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
sudo service mysql restart
Testing: mysql -h 192.168.214.9 -u admin -p mme_db

(2) SPGW IPTABLES
List POSTPROCESSING Rules: iptables -t nat -v -L -n --line-number 
Delete POSTPROCESSING Rules: iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING {number-here}
